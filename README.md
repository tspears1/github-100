# The GitHub 100

## Project Brainstorming
 - provider at root for data of 100 so it can be cached?
 - useRepoData() hook for use in cards and repo 'pages': name, url, star count, author, thumbnail, id
 - filters: search by title, sort by most to least(default) and reverse, sort alphabetically?
 - use framer motion, skeletons, suspense for movement
 - dark mode / light mode toggle - add theme provider
 - Open Props for styles
 - progress/pagination bar at bottom that updates as cards lazy load in
 - click on card to expand into "page" view with list of commits made in last 24 hours (commit author, date, id, message)
 - make sure to add tests
 - Radash?
